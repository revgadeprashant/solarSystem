            Jupiter is the fifth planet from our Sun and is, by far, the largest planet in the solar system – more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined. Jupiter's stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water, floating
            in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter’s iconic Great Red Spot is a giant storm bigger than Earth that has raged for hundreds of years. Jupiter is surrounded by dozens of moons. Jupiter also has several rings, but unlike the famous
            rings of Saturn, Jupiter’s rings are very faint and made of dust, not ice. <br/>
            <br/>
            <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Potential for Life</strong><br> <br> Jupiter’s environment is probably not conducive to life as we know it. The temperatures, pressures, and materials that characterize this planet are most likely
            too extreme and volatile for organisms to adapt to. While planet Jupiter is an unlikely place for living things to take hold, the same is not true of some of its many moons. Europa is one of the likeliest places to find life elsewhere in our
            solar system.
            <br><br>
            <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Size and Distance</strong><br> <br> With a radius of 43,440.7 miles (69,911 kilometers), Jupiter is 11 times wider than Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Jupiter would be about as big as
            a basketball. From an average distance of 484 million miles (778 million kilometers), Jupiter is 5.2 astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance,
            it takes Sunlight 43 minutes to travel from the Sun to Jupiter.
            <br><br>
            <strong style="text-decoration: underline;"> Orbit and Rotation</strong><br> <br> Jupiter has the shortest day in the solar system. One day on Jupiter takes only about 10 hours (the time it takes for Jupiter to rotate or spin around once),
            and Jupiter makes a complete orbit around the Sun (a year in Jovian time) in about 12 Earth years (4,333 Earth days). Its equator is tilted with respect to its orbital path around the Sun by just 3 degrees. This means Jupiter spins nearly
            upright and does not have seasons as extreme as other planets do.

            <br><br>
            <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Moons</strong><br> <br> With four large moons and many smaller moons, Jupiter forms a kind of miniature solar system. Jupiter has 80 moons. Fifty-seven moons have been given official names by the
            International Astronomical Union (IAU). Another 23 moons are awaiting names.
