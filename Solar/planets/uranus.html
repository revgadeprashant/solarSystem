        <P class="uranus_p">
            The seventh planet from the Sun with the third largest diameter in our solar system, Uranus is very cold and windy. The ice giant is surrounded by 13 faint rings and 27 small moons as it rotates at a nearly 90-degree angle from the plane of its orbit.
            This unique tilt makes Uranus appear to spin sideways, orbiting the Sun like a rolling ball. The first planet found with the aid of a telescope, Uranus was discovered in 1781 by astronomer William Herschel, although he originally thought it
            was either a comet or a star. It was two years later that the object was universally accepted as a new planet, in part because of observations by astronomer Johann Elert Bode.

            <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Potential for Life</strong><br> <br> Uranus' environment is not conducive to life as we know it. The temperatures, pressures, and materials that characterize this planet are most likely too extreme
            and volatile for organisms to adapt to.
            <br><br>
            <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Size and Distance</strong><br> <br> With a radius of 15,759.2 miles (25,362 kilometers), Uranus is 4 times wider than Earth. If Earth was the size of a nickel, Uranus would be about as big as a softball.
            From an average distance of 1.8 billion miles (2.9 billion kilometers), Uranus is 19.8 astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight
            2 hours and 40 minutes to travel from the Sun to Uranus.

            <br><br>
            <strong style="text-decoration: underline;"> Orbit and Rotation</strong><br> <br> One day on Uranus takes about 17 hours (the time it takes for Uranus to rotate or spin once). And Uranus makes a complete orbit around the Sun (a year in Uranian
            time) in about 84 Earth years (30,687 Earth days). Uranus is the only planet whose equator is nearly at a right angle to its orbit, with a tilt of 97.77 degrees â€“ possibly the result of a collision with an Earth-sized object long ago. This
            unique tilt causes the most extreme seasons in the solar system. For nearly a quarter of each Uranian year, the Sun shines directly over each pole, plunging the other half of the planet into a 21-year-long, dark winter.
            <br><br>
            <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Moons</strong><br> <br> Uranus has 27 known moons. While most of the satellites orbiting other planets take their names from Greek or Roman mythology, Uranus' moons are unique in being named for
            characters from the works of William Shakespeare and Alexander Pope.
