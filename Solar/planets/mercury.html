        <P class="mercury_p">
            The smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun, Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon. From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when viewed from Earth, and the sunlight would
            be as much as seven times brighter. Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system – that title belongs to nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere. Because of Mercury's elliptical – egg-shaped
            – orbit, and sluggish rotation, the Sun appears to rise briefly, set, and rise again from some parts of the planet's surface. The same thing happens in reverse at sunset. <br/>
            <br/>
            <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Potential for Life</strong><br> <br> Mercury's environment is not conducive to life as we know it. The temperatures and solar radiation that characterize this planet are most likely too extreme for
            organisms to adapt to.
            <br><br>
            <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Size and Distance</strong><br> <br> With a radius of 1,516 miles (2,440 kilometers), Mercury is a little more than 1/3 the width of Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Mercury would be about
            as big as a blueberry. From an average distance of 36 million miles (58 million kilometers), Mercury is 0.4 astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance,
            it takes sunlight 3.2 minutes to travel from the Sun to Mercury.

            <br><br>
            <strong style="text-decoration: underline;"> Orbit and Rotation</strong><br> <br> Mercury's highly eccentric, egg-shaped orbit takes the planet as close as 29 million miles (47 million kilometers) and as far as 43 million miles (70 million
            kilometers) from the Sun. It speeds around the Sun every 88 days, traveling through space at nearly 29 miles (47 kilometers) per second, faster than any other planet. Mercury spins slowly on its axis and completes one rotation every 59 Earth
            days. But when Mercury is moving fastest in its elliptical orbit around the Sun (and it is closest to the Sun), each rotation is not accompanied by sunrise and sunset like it is on most other planets. The morning Sun appears to rise briefly,
            set, and rise again from some parts of the planet's surface. The same thing happens in reverse at sunset for other parts of the surface.

            <br><br>
            <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Moons</strong><br> <br> Mercury doesn't have moons.
