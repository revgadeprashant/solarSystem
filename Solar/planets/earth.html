            Our home planet is the third planet from the Sun, and the only place we know of so far that’s inhabited by living things. While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is the only world in our solar system with liquid water on the
            surface. Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of the four planets closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal. The name Earth is at least 1,000 years old. All of the planets, except for Earth, were named
            after Greek and Roman gods and goddesses. However, the name Earth is a Germanic word, which simply means “the ground.” <br/>
            <br/>
            <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Potential for Life</strong><br> <br> Earth has a very hospitable temperature and mix of chemicals that have made life abundant here. Most notably, Earth is unique in that most of our planet is covered
            in liquid water, since the temperature allows liquid water to exist for extended periods of time. Earth's vast oceans provided a convenient place for life to begin about 3.8 billion years ago.
            <br><br>
            <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Size and Distance</strong><br> <br> With a radius of 3,959 miles (6,371 kilometers), Earth is the biggest of the terrestrial planets and the fifth largest planet overall. From an average distance
            of 93 million miles (150 million kilometers), Earth is exactly one astronomical unit away from the Sun because one astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. This unit provides an easy way to quickly compare
            planets' distances from the Sun.

            <br><br>
            <strong style="text-decoration: underline;"> Orbit and Rotation</strong><br> <br>As Earth orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 23.9 hours. It takes 365.25 days to complete one trip around the Sun. That extra quarter of a day presents
            a challenge to our calendar system, which counts one year as 365 days. To keep our yearly calendars consistent with our orbit around the Sun, every four years we add one day. That day is called a leap day, and the year it's added to is called
            a leap year.

            <br><br>
            <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Moons</strong><br> <br> Earth is the only planet that has a single moon. Our Moon is the brightest and most familiar object in the night sky. In many ways, the Moon is responsible for making Earth
            such a great home. It stabilizes our planet's wobble, which has made the climate less variable over thousands of years.
